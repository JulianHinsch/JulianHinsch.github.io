# about me...

I'm an east coast native - I grew up in New Jersey and have since lived in New York City, Vermont, the Jersey Shore, and Connecticut.  I like sports that involve boots - hiking, skiing, inline-skating, and ice skating.  I get out in the woods whenever I can and I'm a fan of most outdoor activities especially camping and kayaking.

If you want to know about my work experience, check out my [resume](/resume).

I'm also on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-hinsch/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/jhinsch799), and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@jhinsch799).
